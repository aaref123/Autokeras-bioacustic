# Autokeras-bioacustic
this trained version of auto keras  (https://autokeras.com/ )was trained and tested on the Western Mediterranean Wetlands Bird Dataset (https://zenodo.org/records/5091723)
the dataset is a Manually labelled dataset of bird recordings from the species of interest inhabiting in the wetlands of the "Aiguamolls del Empord√†" natural park in Girona, Spain.
the aim of this was to show that the use of automated machine learning on bioaucostics specifically bird song detection can outperfom normal machine learning techniques while being easier to implement without having expert knowledge.
